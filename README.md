🤖 Smart Motor Troubleshooting & Predictive Maintenance Chatbot (Diagnobot)

An AI-based Smart Motor Troubleshooting and Predictive Maintenance application with an interactive chatbot, designed for industrial motor fault diagnosis and maintenance support.
The system analyzes CRT data (Current, Resistance, Temperature) to predict faults and provide motor-specific solutions.

🚀 Project Overview

Diagnobot is a desktop-based application built using Python 3.13 and PyQt6, combining:

A structured motor monitoring dashboard

An AI-powered chatbot for troubleshooting

Predictive maintenance using machine learning (Random Forest)

This project is designed as an industry-oriented mini project with real-world fault scenarios.
